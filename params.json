Add Quartzcore framework to your project. Simply add the `MonthSelector.h` and `MonthSelector.m` files in your project. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n###How to use:\r\nNow in your ViewController.h file, add the `MonthSelectorDelegate` like:\r\n\r\n`@interface ViewController : UIViewController<MonthSelectorDelegate>` \r\n\r\nIn ViewController.m file, create a object for MonthSelector. In `viewDidLoad` initialise the MonthSelector Object like:\r\n\r\n`monthSelector = [[MonthSelector alloc] initWithVerticalPosition:100];`\r\n\r\nwhere vertical position is the position where you want to place this component. \r\n\r\nNow add following lines:\r\n\r\n`monthSelector.delegate = self;`\r\n`[self.view addSubview:monthSelector];`\r\n\r\n\r\nNow define the method for `MonthSelectorDelegate` \r\n\r\n`-(void)didSelectMonth:(NSInteger)month inYear:(NSInteger)year`\r\n\r\nwhere you would receive the month and year as integer.\r\n\r\nI have provided a method(`getMonthString:`) to get the month name in MMM format from integer, which can be used as :\r\n\r\n`NSString *monthName = [monthSelector getMonthString:month];`\r\n\r\nNow run the program.
